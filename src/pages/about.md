An electrical engineer is someone who applies the physics and mathematics of electricity, electromagnetism and electronics to design and develop new electrical equipment and systems, to solve problems and to test equipment. The emergence of the modern age is noted by the introduction of electricity to homes, businesses and industry, all of which were made possible by electrical engineers.

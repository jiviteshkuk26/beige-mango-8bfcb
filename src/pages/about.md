I advance from a nuclear lower-middle-class family in New Delhi, India. I am practical-oriented and I prioritize gaining practical knowledge over theoretical knowledge. As a fast learner, I can imbibe fresh skills in a quick time and stick to ethics. Some of my hobbies include computing, 3D modeling, robot combats, flying drones, and experimenting with electronics.
